# Expense Tracker Web Application

## Overview
This project is a full-stack, session-based expense tracking web application that allows users to manage personal finances across multiple expense files (ledgers). Each user can create, manage, and analyze expenses in isolated files, ensuring complete data ownership and clarity.

The application emphasizes correctness, usability, and analytical clarity rather than unnecessary complexity.

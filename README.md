# EXPENSE-TRACKER
This project is a simple Expense Tracker desktop application developed using Python and Tkinter. It is designed to help users keep track of their daily spending through a clean and interactive graphical interface. The application allows users to enter expenses by specifying details like the item name, amount, and category, and it dynamically displays all entries in a list format within the same window. As users log new expenses, the app automatically calculates and displays the total amount spent. It is built entirely in one Python file without using a database or external storage, making it lightweight and easy to run. This project can be especially useful for individuals who want a minimal, offline tool to monitor their personal finances or for beginners looking to learn GUI development with Tkinter.
